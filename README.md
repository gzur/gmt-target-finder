# GMT Target Finder
A target finder greasemonkey created the GMT Breakfast Club for Kevan Davis' Urban Dead (http://www.urbandead.com)
Expects a url of the form 
`http://www.urbandead.com/map.cgi?GmtbcTarget=X,Y`
Example:
`http://www.urbandead.com/map.cgi?GmtbcTarget=45,40`
will take you to The Neagle Building in beautiful Barrville.

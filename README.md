# GMT Target Finder
A target finder greasemonkey created the GMT Breakfast Club for Kevan Davis' [Urban Dead](http://www.urbandead.com)

## Example:

The GMT Target Finder expects a url of the form `http://www.urbandead.com/map.cgi?GmtbcTarget=X,Y`

For example 
`http://www.urbandead.com/map.cgi?GmtbcTarget=45,40`
will highlight the path to The Neagle Building in beautiful Barrville.
